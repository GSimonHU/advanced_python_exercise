# Advanced Python Exercise

## Story

As part of my studies, I completed this exercise using advanced Python concepts, such as destructuring, list comprehension, lambda functions, to name a few.
Exercise came with tests, to check it out please run `python3 -m doctest functions.py -v` in the terminal from the program directory.

## Tasks

1. Parse a line describing user data in the format: `FirstName LastName usernameexample.com`. Return a tuple: `(first_name, last_name, user, host)`

2. Compare two lists of file names, and find the files that were removed or added. Return a dictionary with two keys:
- 'removed': sorted list of removed files
- 'added': sorted list of added files

3. Write out a log line in a specific format.

4. Find the biggest rectangle in a sequence. Rectangles are represented as tuples of `(width, height)`.

5. Find a pattern in file. Print out all lines that match the pattern (case-insensitive) with line numbers.

6. Read all words from a file that are longer than given length. Convert to lowercase, and remove punctuation.

7. Find top `n` words in a file. Return a list of tuples (word, count), ordered by descending count.
